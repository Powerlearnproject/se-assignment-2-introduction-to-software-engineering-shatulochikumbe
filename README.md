Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is the designing, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the designing, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. Traditional programming is focused on coding to solve specific problems. Therefore, software engineering happens throught the lifecycle i.e. from conception to maintenance leading to software development.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Project Planning
   Cost estimstes and defining requirements for the new software is conducted at this phase. It helps answer what the software will be all about.
2. Gathering Requirements and Analysis
   This phase involves getting more information on the product which the clients needs.Analysis of the requirements is done as designing and coding of the software will be conducted.
3. Design
   The software developer checks if he/she meets the reuirements of the client and this is done by choosing the best design approach such as Java, Javascript and C++.
4. Coding or Implementation
   After choosing the design to be used, the design as to be translated in computer language which is coding. This is the longest phase of the lifecycle.
5. Testing
   This is ensuring that the system is functioning well and according to client requirements. If any bugs are detected, the developer fixes them and sends it back to Quality Assurance team to check until no bugs can be detected.
6. Deployment
   This stage enable to client to use the software and training is done on how to effectively use the software.
7. Maintenance
    This involves updating of the software system or application from time to time by the software developer (BETSOL,2024).

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1. Agile is flexible and iterative, hence focusing on continuous feedback and adaptation while Waterfall is seqential and rigid with distinct phases completed in order.
2. Agile is less expensive than Waterfall
3. Faster delivery with Agile as a big project can be broken smaller projects than Waterfall
Agile is ideal for startup business projects which require continuous improvements while Waterfall is ideal for government and large-scale projects with regulatory compliance needs(Forecast Team).

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining client requirements. The process has 5 stages.
1. Feasibility study
   This involves checking if the resources will be adequate for updating the system and the cost of the software system or application. This is important in software development lifecycle as it helps in project planning.
2. Requirements Elicitation
   This stage involves gathering more information about the product domain from the client and stakeholders. This can be done through interviews, surveys and focus group discussions. It is also impoertant as requirements for client should be met.
3. Requirement Specification
   This stage points out what the software can and canot do. It specifies the constraints of the system or application and provides solutions to the constraints found. This works hand in hand with testing the software developed application or syatem.
4. Requirements Verification and Validation
   A software should be able to correctly implement a specific function  and it must meet client requirements. The requirements should be consistent, complete and correct.  This stage helps in deployment of the software to the needed end-user.
5. Requirements Management
   This is a process of analysing, documenting, tracking, priotising and agreeing on the requirement and controlling communication with relevant stakeholders. It manages the requirements which is the same as maintenance (geeksforgeeks.org). 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Concept of modularity in software design is having information within a module while showing only needed information while hiding the rest. By dividing the software into separate, indipendent modules, it helps improve maintainability and scalability of software systems (ITU).

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

1. Unit Testing 
   This is a type of testing done by developers before handing the software to the testing team. 
2. Integration Testing
   This is a type of software testing where individual software components are logically integrated and tested as a group. 
3. System Testing
   This level of testing identifies bugs and challenges while ensuring that the software meets all specific requirements. 
4. Acceptance Testing
   This type of testing determines whether or not the software should be released to the public.
All the above testings are important in software development because they add have to it help fix bugs before releasing the end product to the clients (Anshuman Singh).

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems are software tools that help software teams to manage changes to source code overtime(Atlassian, 2024). Examples of vesion control systems (FULLSCALE, 2024)
1. GitHub
   It has code review available in a private cloud with GitHub Enterprise.
2. Apache Subversion
   Key features are inventory management, security management, history tracking and user access controls.
3. Microsoft Team Foundation Server
   It has features such as Team Build an Team Project Portal

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software peoject manager manages software projects and ensures that the projects are successfully completed (geeks for geeks). 
Responsibilities (TatvaSoft Software Development Compant, 2024)
1. Planning
2. Oversee the Software Development Team
3. Monitoring Progress and tracking roadblocks
4. Managing deployment deliverables
Challenges (thedevpost.com)
1. Unclear and undefined expectations
2. Time constraint
3. Poor communication
4. Under estimation of costs

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with client needs. There are 4 types of maintenance activites.
1. Corrective Software Maintenance
   This is a typical and classical form of maintenance. It is necessary when something goes wrong in a pieceof software including faults and errors.
2. Preventative Software Maintenance
   This ensures that the software keeps working as desired for as long as possible. This includes necessary changes and upgrades. This also address small issues which in future can be large issues called latent faults.
3. Perfective Software Maintenance
   This adjusts the softwares by adding new features as necessary and removing unnecessary features. This process keeps softwares as the market and user needs change.
4. Adaptive Software Maintenance
   This process includes changing technologies as well as policies and and rules regarding the software. When changes have been made, the software has to adapt to the new requirements and continue to run well.
Software maintenance is important because it has to keep up with market changes and demands (Thales, 2024). 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues
1. Unethical data collection
2. Algorithmic bias
3. Weak security
4. Wrong priorities
Solutions
1. Be proactive
2. Be honest
3. Be accountable
4. Be a responsible citizen (FULLSCALE, 2024)
